# AllAllAboutSingletons

## Singleton is:
used when a particular class should only have one object in the entire program

## Example:
* The class used to communicate with database
* Logger object which is initialized in multiple classes to log different actions

## Note: 
Singletons, though a useful pattern, should be avoided as much as possible. They make testing a daunting task
